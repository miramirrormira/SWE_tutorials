# Todo for each problem

1. Solve the problem without looking at the solution. Talk aloud while working through this step. If stuck, look at the solution and understand which step was the sticking point, then go back to solve the problem with the updated understanding of the problem and solution without looking at the solution. 

2. Record the time spend solving a problem with the goal being able to solve each problem in under 5 minutes. 

3. Improve my understanding of the problem:
Compute the time complexity for the problem
Look at the humps in the submitted answers and study what makes a given solution efficient or inefficient.  

4. Explain the problem as if Iâ€™m speaking with an interviewer. 

5. Seek an insight that can be extracted from the problem
List any questions I have about the problem and ask

6. Note keeping:
- write down the algo in paper, especially the one that was hard for you
- write down any concepts that you've learned solving this problem
- write down any new coding patterns that was used to solve this problem
- Don't be afraid of repetition if two problems are similar still be comprehensive when asking the above questions of both problems in writing the answers down

7. Whenever you feel like there are things that give you anxiety in DSA, e.g. I still don't know what kind of problems does sliding window solve, write them down the list and solve every one of them
